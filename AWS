## Introduction

---

Today we're going to walk through Amazon Web Services (AWS). In particular, we'll focus on the services that are commonly used in data science. AWS are cloud computing services; they're essentially virtual machines that you pay to access for the amount of time you need them. 

**Check:** What is a server?

**Check:** What did the world look like before AWS (and Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, etc.)?

## Creating an EC2 Instance

---

1. From your [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home), type `EC2` in the search bar. This will send you to the EC2 dashboard.

2. From the EC2 Dashboard, click "Launch Instance"

![](images/ec2-launch-instance-btn.png)

3. Choose the default image:

![](images/ec2-choose-image.png)

4. Choose instance size, and then click "Review and Launch":
**NOTE**: Be conservative, it's a huge pain to run out of memory.

5. Click "Launch"

6. After that a modal window will prompt you to either create or choose an
   existing `.pem` file. 
  - If you have one you'd like to use, choose that. 
  - If you
need a new one, do the following:
    1. Choose "Create a new key pair"
    2. Ideally give it a lower case name with no spaces.
    3. Click "Download key pair". AWS won't let you click "Launch Instances" until you download your key pair
    4. Using terminal, you'll need to `cd` to the directory that the .pem file is
      in and type the following: `chmod 400 YOUR-PEM-FILE.pem`

7. Click the link similar to the one below to take you to your instance page:

![](images/ec2-launch-status.png)

8. Eventually you'll see a green dot next to your instance, letting you know
   it's ready. Take note of of the "Public DNS" line. You'll use that url to
SSH into your instance.

## Connecting to your EC2 Instance

---

Go to your [EC2 Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home).

Click on '# Running Instances' ([Screenshot](https://www.evernote.com/l/ACgQaxMlF_RJNoJJcCYBYYaWZuh0yuRZILY))

Click the checkbox of the instance you want to SSH in to ([Screenshot](https://www.evernote.com/l/ACgSQqFPnupNq6e_J5w_DHeBTWXAdHyrYGs))

Copy the Public DNS to your clipboard ([Screenshot](https://www.evernote.com/l/ACgxKQ946cBJ4ZdOdCH2cAz9dIzHIFA1qtM))

In terminal, navigate to the directory your .pem file is in

```bash
cd the-directory-your-pem-file-is-located/
ssh -i YOUR-PEM-FILE.pem ec2-user@PASTE-YOUR-PUBLIC-DNS-HERE
```

You've successfully SSH'ed if you see the following:

```

       __|  __|_  )
       _|  (     /   Amazon Linux AMI
      ___|\___|___|

https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/2017.03-release-notes/
1 package(s) needed for security, out of 1 available
Run "sudo yum update" to apply all updates.
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-12-226 ~]$ 
```

If you see `Run "sudo yum update" to apply all updates.` then run: 
```
sudo yum update
```

You're all set! If this is your first time to `ssh` into this instance, you'll
probably want to install Anaconda on your instance (see below!).


### Unprotected key file

If you see the following warning when trying to SSH:
```bash
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@         WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!          @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Permissions 0644 for 'YOUR-PEM-FILE.pem' are too open.
It is required that your private key files are NOT accessible by others.
This private key will be ignored.
Load key "dsi.pem": bad permissions
Permission denied (publickey).
```

Type the following:
```bash
chmod 400 YOUR-PEM-FILE.pem
```

After that, try the `ssh` command again.

### Downloading the bash file

Go to the [Anaconda downloads page](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)

Scroll down a bit and click on the Linux tab. [Screenshot](https://www.evernote.com/l/ACiIm3yPQ-1Dba-daaGyGMsOVGzEmSI9vDg)

Right-click the green button under Python 3.x and copy the link address. [Screenshot](https://www.evernote.com/l/ACg18al-QBJAgZXESh7UgYbHF5ibFhKVqY0).

SSH into your EC2 instance and type the following:

```bash
wget PASTE-YOUR-ANACONDA-URL.sh
```

You should see a loading bar similar to the following [screenshot](https://www.evernote.com/l/ACggCQF7bB1GPZePBHY47znZfCr36h_BQis). 


### Installation

Once the file is downloaded, type the following:

```bash
bash Ana<tab>
```
`<tab>` will autocomplete with the full name of the Anaconda file you downloaded.

When you see the following, press enter:
```bash
In order to continue the installation process, please review the license
agreement.
Please, press ENTER to continue
>>> 
```

If you see `--More--` keep pressing `space` until you see the following:
```bash
Do you approve the license terms? [yes|no]
>>> 
```

Type `yes`.

When you see the following:
```bash
Anaconda3 will now be installed into this location:
/home/ec2-user/anaconda3

  - Press ENTER to confirm the location
  - Press CTRL-C to abort the installation
  - Or specify a different location below

[/home/ec2-user/anaconda3] >>> 
```
Hit `<enter>` to select the default location

At this point the script will start to download all the necessary packages. Once it's done, you'll see the following:
```bash
Do you wish the installer to prepend the Anaconda3 install location
to PATH in your /home/ec2-user/.bashrc ? [yes|no]
[no] >>> 
```

Type `yes` and hit `<enter>`. 

Finally, type `source ~/.bash_profile` to reload your terminal.

You're all set!

## Copying Files to an EC2 Instance

---

### Intro

SCP is how files are transferred from your machine to your EC2 instance (and vice versa). It works the same way as the `cp` command. The only difference is you're transferring files from one machine to another, rather than one directory to another.

### Steps

Go to your [EC2 Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home).

Click on '# Running Instances' ([Screenshot](https://www.evernote.com/l/ACgQaxMlF_RJNoJJcCYBYYaWZuh0yuRZILY))

Click the checkbox of the instance in question ([Screenshot](https://www.evernote.com/l/ACgSQqFPnupNq6e_J5w_DHeBTWXAdHyrYGs))

Copy the Public DNS to your clipboard ([Screenshot](https://www.evernote.com/l/ACgxKQ946cBJ4ZdOdCH2cAz9dIzHIFA1qtM))

### SCP from your computer to EC2

In your terminal, navigate to the directory your .pem file is in

```bash
cd THE-DIR-YOUR-PEM-FILE-IS-LOCATED/
scp -i YOUR-PEM-FILE.pem THE-FILE-YOU-WANT-TO-SCP.csv ec2-user@PASTE-YOUR-PUBLIC-DNS-HERE:~/
```

**NOTE**: The `:~/` at the end of the DNS specifies which directory on the EC2 instance you want to transfer to. In this case, you're wanting your file to live in the home directory (hence the tilde).

### SCP from EC2 to your computer

SCP from EC2 to your machine works the exact same way, only in reverse. In your terminal, navigate to the directory your .pem file is in

```bash
cd THE-DIR-YOUR-PEM-FILE-IS-LOCATED/
scp -i YOUR-PEM-FILE.pem ec2-user@PASTE-YOUR-PUBLIC-DNS-HERE:~/THE-FILE-YOU-WANT-TO-SCP.csv .
```

**NOTE**: The `.` at the end of the command specifies that you want to copy the file from EC2 to the current directory on your machine.

## Installing Git on EC2 Instance (optional)

---

SSH into your instance and type the following:

```bash
sudo yum install git
```

Once the installation is done, you should be able to type the following without an error:
```bash
git --version
```

**NOTE**: When you clone a repo, make sure you're using the https protocol. [Screenshot](https://www.evernote.com/l/AChHUErTBPRDj5_pT6PNAP1385tdBOyUqOw). If your clone url starts with `git@...`, click "Use HTTPS" ([Screenshot](https://www.evernote.com/l/ACi2Mf-asJlOx59-RpgCaQM0lnYQ9M0gn-Y)).
